 BRUNO URBAN ALFARO

THIS IS MY LIBRARY IN JAVA FOR THE PROGRAMMING CLASS OF THE ANTONIO DE NEBRIJA UNIVERSITY.

-I HAVE INITIALIZED A SERIES OF PRODUCT LISTS.

-THE USER IS LOCATED WITH NAME AND PASSWORD AND WILL BE ABLE TO BUY, SELL AND CONSULT PRODUCTS. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO BECOME A PREMIUM USER IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY, WHICH WILL PROVIDE YOU A DISCOUNT IN THE FINAL ACCOUNT.

-THE PRODUCTS ARE BOOKS, FILMS AND MUSIC, THAT WOUND THE CLASS PRODUCT WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES AND LISTS. THERE IS ALSO A GENERIC LIST THAT HOUSES THE SHOPPING CART AND CONTAINS THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT.

-MY PROGRAM IS INTERNATIONALIZED IN SPANISH, ENGLISH AND JAPANESS, WITH POSSIBILITY TO ADD MORE LANGUAGES.

-IT ALSO HAS A SEARCH FUNCTION. YOU CAN SEARCH FOR A PRODUCT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU THE AUTHOR (IT IS PROGRAMMED WITH INTERFACE AS MY TEACHER ASKED)

-IT ALSO HAS A BUBBLE FUNCTION, AND IT SORTS THE PRODUCTS IN THEIR YEARÂ´S ORDER.

-IT ALSO HAS A LOTTERY THAT IS DELIVERED AT THE END OF THE PURCHASE AND THAT IS MADE BY A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY THAT CREATES A SUCCESSION OF RANDOM NUMBERS TO GENERATE THE TICKET.

-ALL FUNCTIONS HAVE THEIR RESPECTIVE TESTS IN OPERATION (FOR EXAMPLE, "LOTERIATEST" CREATES THE WINNER TICKET THE SAME AS THE USER'S TICKET ON PURPOSE TO CHECK IF COMPARING THEM WORKS IN "GETGANADORA()")
